  "architecturalNotes": [
    "Frontend is a React SPA composed of section components (Hero, Services, Gallery, Contact, Footer) assembled in App.tsx.",
    "Styling uses Tailwind CSS with CSS-variable-driven OKLCH color tokens and dark mode via the 'class' strategy; tailwind plugins include typography, container-queries, and tailwindcss-animate.",
    "UI primitives are imported from a local '@/components/ui/*' layer (likely shadcn/ui + Radix patterns), e.g., Card and Dialog.",
    "Frontend includes an authentication layer using Internet Identity via @dfinity/auth-client, exposed through a React Context provider (InternetIdentityProvider) with derived status flags.",
    "Actor creation is encapsulated in a React Query hook (useActor) that produces either an anonymous or identity-bound actor and invalidates/refetches non-actor queries on identity changes.",
    "Backend is a Motoko canister that composes functionality via an `include MixinStorage();` mixin pattern (modular capability injection).",
    "Backend storage authorization uses a mutable in-memory registry of authorized principals, refreshed by querying a 'cashier' canister whose principal is provided via an environment variable.",
    "Backend interacts with IC system primitives (Prim.*) for storage blob liveness/dead blob enumeration/pruning and triggers explicit GC via a special __motoko_gc_trigger call."
  ],
  "knownIssues": [
    "frontend contains two different CSS files listed: frontend/src/index.css (bakery-themed OKLCH palette) and frontend/index.css (generic palette). This duplication may cause confusion or incorrect styling depending on which file is actually imported/built (main.tsx imports './index.css' from src).",
    "Gallery.tsx maintains `selectedImage` state but never uses it (the dialog uses `image.src` directly).",
    "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts is an empty placeholder; any expectation of data fetching is currently unimplemented by design.",
    "Frontend is largely static but still includes React Query + Internet Identity + actor creation plumbing; currently no shown components actually use the actor or identity to call the backend.",
    "Internet Identity provider URL is sourced from `process.env.II_URL`; missing/incorrect env config will break login flows.",
    "Backend requires `CAFFFEINE_STORAGE_CASHIER_PRINCIPAL` env var; if unset, getCashierPrincipal traps and dependent calls fail.",
    "Storage.refillCashier computes `Nat.sub(currentBalance, reservedCycles)` which can trap/underflow if currentBalance < reservedCycles; there is no guard.",
    "Authorized principals registry in the backend is `transient` and not stable; it will reset on upgrades/redeploys until `_caffeineStorageUpdateGatewayPrincipals` is called again.",
    "_caffeineStorageUpdateGatewayPrincipals is callable by anyone (no authorization check), potentially allowing untrusted callers to trigger repeated remote calls to the cashier canister (resource/DoS concern).",
    "_caffeineStorageCreateCertificate returns a static {method='upload', blob_hash=...} response and does not validate blob hashes or caller authorization (may be incomplete/stub behavior)."
