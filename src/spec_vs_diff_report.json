  "summary": "Diff largely implements a 6-section single-page AI ebook landing page with consistent WhatsApp CTA link and updated tech-style palette, but some text/copy requirements cannot be verified as exact, required static image assets are not shown as added, and there are unrequested edits to constrained/legacy components (including an immutable-path hook).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "All user-facing text matches the user-provided headings/subheadings/reviews/disclaimer verbatim (except where wording was left open-ended).",
      "reason": "Some visible headings/text in the diff do not match the specified section naming and/or are likely placeholders; exact user-provided review text/bullets are not reflected as-is.",

        "frontend/src/components/Reviews.tsx (heading: \"What People Are Saying\")",

      "requirement": "Implement the “Why Choose This Guide?” section with the exact title and bullet points provided by the user.",

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Social Proof / Reviews section contains exactly 3 short reviews using the exact text provided by the user (including the star symbol).",
      "reason": "Component displays 3 reviews, but the strings appear to be newly written and the star handling removes the leading star from the rendered text (`review.substring(2)`), so the displayed review text likely does not match the required verbatim strings.",
